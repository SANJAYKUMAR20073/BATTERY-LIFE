# ABSTRACT
The surging demand for electric vehicles (EVs) underscores the critical need for accurate prediction of EV car battery life, a pivotal factor influencing performance and consumer confidence. This study meticulously delves into this imperative by focusing on the development of predictive models for estimating battery life in EVs through advanced machine learning techniques. Data analysis entails a comprehensive examination of diverse factors impacting battery life, including battery specifications, charging patterns, usage conditions, and environmental influences. Leveraging extensive datasets of historical EV data, machine learning algorithms are intricately trained to forecast battery life with unprecedented precision, offering profound insights into the intricate dynamics at play. Model evaluation constitutes a rigorous assessment process, employing robust metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics serve as robust indicators of model performance, guiding iterative refinements and optimizations. The trained models are not transient artifacts but meticulously preserved for future deployment. This facilitates continual enhancement in battery life prediction, fostering ongoing research endeavors in the field. By advancing battery life prediction techniques, this study significantly contributes to the sustainable growth of the EV market and advocates for cleaner transportation solutions. This research underscores the paramount importance of accurate battery life prediction in propelling EV technology forward and driving widespread adoption. The findings highlight the transformative potential of machine learning in addressing automotive challenges, fueling innovation, and ushering in a new era of electric mobility.
