# ABSTRACT
The surging demand for electric vehicles (EVs) underscores the critical need for accurate prediction of EV car battery life, a pivotal factor influencing performance and consumer confidence. This study meticulously delves into this imperative by focusing on the development of predictive models for estimating battery life in EVs through advanced machine learning techniques. Data analysis entails a comprehensive examination of diverse factors impacting battery life, including battery specifications, charging patterns, usage conditions, and environmental influences. Leveraging extensive datasets of historical EV data, machine learning algorithms are intricately trained to forecast battery life with unprecedented precision, offering profound insights into the intricate dynamics at play. Model evaluation constitutes a rigorous assessment process, employing robust metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics serve as robust indicators of model performance, guiding iterative refinements and optimizations. The trained models are not transient artifacts but meticulously preserved for future deployment. This facilitates continual enhancement in battery life prediction, fostering ongoing research endeavors in the field. By advancing battery life prediction techniques, this study significantly contributes to the sustainable growth of the EV market and advocates for cleaner transportation solutions. This research underscores the paramount importance of accurate battery life prediction in propelling EV technology forward and driving widespread adoption. The findings highlight the transformative potential of machine learning in addressing automotive challenges, fueling innovation, and ushering in a new era of electric mobility.
Electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a pivotal innovation in the automotive industry, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. Powered by rechargeable batteries, EVs contribute significantly to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and lessening dependence on fossil fuels, aligning with global sustainability goals. As the adoption of EVs continues to escalate worldwide, optimizing vehicle performance and durability becomes increasingly critical. This study takes a unique approach by exploring predictive models for estimating EV car battery life without relying on traditional battery management systems (BMS) or digital twin technologies. While conventional approaches emphasize the role of battery management systems (BMS) in overseeing and regulating battery conditions, this study takes a distinct path by exploring predictive models for estimating EV car battery life without direct reliance on BMS technology. Furthermore, while digital twin technology has garnered attention for its potential to revolutionize EV battery management, this study diverges by focusing on leveraging machine learning techniques for battery life prediction without direct integration of digital twins. Instead, the research endeavors to develop predictive models based on historical EV data, offering valuable insights into battery performance and longevity. The exploration of previous research in related fields offers valuable context for understanding the evolving landscape of EV technology. While acknowledging the significance of BMS and digital twin technologies, this study underscores the potential of alternative methodologies, particularly the application of machine learning, in optimizing EV battery performance. Key studies in battery management, real-time optimization of charging profiles, energy management strategies, and predictive maintenance provide foundational knowledge and guide the research direction. By embracing innovative approaches, this study seeks to contribute to the ongoing evolution of EV technology and address challenges in battery management, ultimately promoting the widespread adoption of sustainable transportation solutions.
